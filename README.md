## focus your audio

Welcome to beatnik, an interactive web application that syncs a user's personal Spotify tracks with three dimensional webgl visual based on audio parameters. Beatnik utilizes the Spotify developer API, rspotify ruby wrapper, PoetryDB, threejs library, and the web audio API. While graphics load, a poem of the beat genre will be displayed.
