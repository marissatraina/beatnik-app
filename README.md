## focus your audio

Welcome to *beatnik*, an interactive web application that syncs a user's personal Spotify tracks with a three dimensional webgl visual based on audio parameters. Beatnik utilizes the Spotify developer API, rspotify ruby wrapper, PoetryDB, threejs library, and the web audio API. While graphics load, a poem of the beat genre is displayed.
